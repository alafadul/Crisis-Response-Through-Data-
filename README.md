# 🧠 Economic Crisis KPI Dashboard: 2008 vs. COVID-19  
**📊 A Data-Driven Analysis of U.S. Government Responses Using Interest Rates, GDP, Money Supply, Unemployment & Federal Debt**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project compares the **2008 Financial Crisis** and the **COVID-19 economic shock** through a business intelligence lens. By tracking **key performance indicators (KPIs)** — including **interest rates, GDP, unemployment, money supply, and federal debt** — the analysis highlights how different U.S. administrations responded to financial turmoil and which strategies proved effective.

> **Tools Used**: Excel (Data Cleaning) • Tableau (Dashboards & KPIs) • FRED & FDIC Public Economic Datasets

---

## 📈 Key Insights

### 💸 Interest Rates
- **2008**: Fed slashed rates from ~5.25% to 0.25% over 1 year
- **COVID-19**: Rates dropped to near-zero within 1 month (March 2020)

> ✅ *Both crises triggered rate cuts, but COVID-19 response was faster.*

---

### 📉 GDP Drop
- **2008**: GDP fell ~4.3% peak-to-trough
- **COVID-19**: ~9.1% drop in Q2 2020 — the steepest post-WWII

> 📊 *GDP rebounded faster post-COVID due to digital adaptation and stimulus.*

---

### 💼 Unemployment
- **2008**: Peaked at 10% (Oct 2009)
- **COVID-19**: Spiked to 14.8% in April 2020 — then declined quickly

> 🧠 *COVID’s labor shock was sharper but shorter-lived.*

---

### 🧾 Federal Debt
- **2008**: $10.7T → $13.5T  
- **COVID-19**: $23T → $30.9T

> ⚠️ *COVID response drove historically high debt growth due to stimulus (CARES Act).*

---

### 💰 Money Supply (M2)
- **2008**: Grew moderately during initial QE  
- **COVID-19**: Massive M2 expansion (~20% YoY)

> 🔥 *Unprecedented M2 growth contributed to inflation pressures in 2021–22.*

| Category | 2008 Crisis | COVID-19 |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Speed of Action** | Reactive & slower | Proactive & immediate |
| **Monetary Policy** | Gradual cuts, late QE | Instant rate cuts + aggressive QE |
| **Fiscal Measures** | TARP ($700B) bailout | CARES Act ($2.2T), direct payments |
| **Labor Strategy** | Extended UI late | Stimulus checks + expanded UI fast |
| **Sector Focus** | Banking, housing | Broad: healthcare, households, business |

> ✅ *COVID-19 response was broader, faster, and more inclusive — reflecting lessons learned from 2008.*

## 🔍 Policy Lessons & Opportunities

1. **Speed Matters**: COVID-19 response was immediate, proving vital.
2. **Debt Trade-Off**: Aggressive aid fueled recovery but also inflation risk.
3. **Transparency Wins**: Real-time data tracking enabled smarter decisions.
4. **Long-Term Planning Gap**: Both crises lacked a sustainable debt strategy post-recovery.
